# Assignment 3
In this assignment you will get some data in csv form and use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to look at it, clean the data, and construct a new feature.

## Introduction
Refer to the Pandas and DataFrames slides.  Look at the notes books in the Sample Analysis directory under csis-machine-learning. There are three of them and they give what I saw when analyzing three different sets of data related to a possible question.

You may also look at the ReadCSV notebook in the DataFrames directory in the  csis-machine-learning repository. 
  

## What to do
Modify the Assignment3 note book by adding in code and text to them cells below to finish the tasks listed.
## Submission
### Process:  There are multiple parts to the assignment. Fill in the code and notes cells associated with each part.  You should not need to add in extra cells, but if you feel the need, do so.   
### Commit and Push
Anytime you complete a part, you are required to commit to your local personalized copy of the repository. You will then push to the github repository.  Use good commit messages.  _Points will be deducted if you don't commit for each part._  Note:  It is always acceptable to make a change to a section later. Just remember to commit and push your work.
