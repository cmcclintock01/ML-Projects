# Conclusion
Story: An MLB team is looking forward to the upcoming 2024 MLB draft and are trying to figure out which players are going to excel the best when they join the team. Now all of the other teams are looking hundreds of different stats that the player has and is trying to find the person with the best. The MLB teams that knows which specific stats to look at is going to do the best job at finding players fast. The MLB teams could change their features they want to use so that they are helping out the team needs. Let's say the team is having trouble with walks and wants someone that gets more walks. They will be able to add walks into the model. After choosing the different features they find the most useful they will be able to generate a score and filter the players using that data.

# Main Findings
In the file, [ensemble](https://github.com/44-566-Machine-Learning-F23/ml-project-cmcclintock01/blob/master/Ensemble.ipynb). I was able to really see how well each feature did. The Hits, Strikeouts, and Walks were the most correlated to the AVG_group and was able to place the players in the correct group from 30-40% of the time. If MLB teams were wanting to judge how well a player could do in the next few weeks they would want to use these data features over an others.
